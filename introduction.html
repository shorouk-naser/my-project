        worldwide impact in health and socioeconomic terms; according to data 
        provided by Johns Hopkins University [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h1">1</a>],
         by 2020, September 21, the number of global cases passed 31 million 
        with more than 960,000 deaths. Furthermore, the pandemic is certainly 
        having an unprecedented impact also on food systems. This is what ITU, 
        the United Nationsâ€™ specialized agency for ICT, reported on its online 
        resource ITU News [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h2">2</a>].</span></p>
        
        <p class="rfont" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 24px;">WHO declared COVID-19 disease a public health emergency of international concern on 2020, January 30 [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h3">3</a>]. The 2020 edition of the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h4">4</a>],
         published on 2020, April 20 as the result of a joint, consensus-based 
        assessment of acute food insecurity situations around the world, 
        describes the worldwide scale of acute hunger. GRFC-2020 provides an 
        analysis of the drivers that are contributing to food crises across the 
        globe, and examines how the COVID-19 pandemic might contribute to their 
        perpetuation or deterioration. When comparing the 50 countries taken 
        into account in both the 2019 and the 2020 reports, the population in 
        crisis rose from 112 to 123 million. This reflected worsening acute food
         insecurity in key conflict-driven crises and the growing severity of 
        drought and economic shocks. Around 183 million people in 47 countries 
        were classified in stressed conditions, at risk of slipping into crisis 
        or worse. As stated by Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United
         Nations (UN) and reported on GRFC-2020 [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h4">4</a>],
         the upheaval that has been set in motion by the COVID-19 pandemic may 
        push even more families and communities into deeper distress.</span></p>
        
        <p class="rfont" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 24px;">Even before COVID-19 began to affect food systems and 
        agricultural livelihoods, the 55 countries and territories that are home
         to 135 million people were already facing acute food insecurity [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h2">2</a>, <a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h4">4</a>].
         Such people are in need of urgent humanitarian food and nutrition 
        assistance and are the most vulnerable to the consequences of this 
        pandemic as they have very limited or no capacity to cope with either 
        the health or socioeconomic aspects of the shock. Rising levels of food 
        insecurity and lack of access to healthcare are likely to increase 
        malnutrition rates. On the food supply side, movement restrictions 
        necessary to contain the spread of the virus will disrupt the transport 
        and processing of food and other critical goods, increasing delivery 
        times and reducing availability of even the most basic food items [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h4">4</a>].</span></p>
        
        <p class="rfont" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 24px;">Conclusions of GRFC-2020 state that, given the 
        unprecedented nature of COVID-19 crisis, taking rapid collective action 
        to pre-empt its impact on food security and food systems is of paramount
         importance and urgency. In particular, anticipatory actions have to be 
        undertaken to safeguard the livelihoods of the most vulnerable people 
        and related agri-food systems to protect the critical food supply chain.
         Early actions for mitigation include, among others, expanding near-real
         time, remote food security monitoring systems to provide up-to-date 
        information on the impacts of the outbreak on food security and 
        livelihoods, health, access to services, markets and supply chains [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h4">4</a>].</span></p>
        
        <p class="rfont" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 24px;">In this framework ICT, applied computer science and 
        artificial intelligence (AI) will support sustainable development 
        worldwide and in particular can play a key role in help shaping the 
        future of food safety. The aim of the present work is outlining how 
        state-of-the-art and trends of such technologies could be useful for the
         whole agri-food sector.</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><br></p>
