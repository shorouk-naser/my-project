<p class="rfont" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 24px;">ICT and AI are already helping in agriculture and food engineering [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h5">5</a>]:
 picking vegetables, controlling pest infestations, soil and crop health
 monitoring and predictive analysis are only a few examples. Improving 
food traceability as well as the efficiency that can be gained through 
robotics, automation and digitization in supply chain logistics are some
 of key requirements for the near future of food safety. Indeed, 
notwithstanding the essential role of farm, factory and food workers, it
 is recognized that any human interaction with the food value chain, at 
least in the context of a virus, presents some risk [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h2">2</a>].</span></p>

<p class="rfont" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 24px;">COVID-19 is a respiratory illness and the most recent advice from the WHO [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h6">6</a>]
 is that current evidence indicates that the primary transmission route 
of COVID-19 virus is through person-to-person contact and through direct
 contact with respiratory droplets generated when an infected person 
coughs or sneezes. There is no evidence to date of viruses that cause 
respiratory illnesses being transmitted via food or food packaging. 
Coronaviruses cannot multiply in food; they need an animal or human host
 to multiply. The virus can spread directly from person-to-person when a
 COVID-19 case coughs or sneezes, producing droplets that reach the 
nose, mouth, or eyes of another person [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h7">7</a>].</span></p>

<p class="rfont" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 24px;">Alternatively, as the respiratory droplets are too 
heavy to be airborne, they land on objects and surfaces surrounding the 
infected person. It is possible that someone may become infected by 
touching a contaminated surface, object, or the hand of an infected 
person and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. This can 
happen, for instance, when touching door knobs or shaking hands and then
 touching the face [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h7">7</a>].</span></p>

<p class="rfont" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 24px;">Recent research evaluated the survival of the COVID-19 
virus on different surfaces and reported that the virus can remain 
viable for up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel, up to four 
hours on copper, and up to 24 hours on cardboard [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h8">8</a>].
 Then, it is imperative for the food industry to reinforce personal 
hygiene measures and provide refresher training on food hygiene 
principles to eliminate or reduce the risk of food surfaces and food 
packaging materials becoming contaminated with the virus from food 
workers.</span></p><p><br></p></div>
