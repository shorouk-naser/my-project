spread of coronavirus protecting workers’ health but if cleaning crews 
do not wear appropriate PPE, they themselves are at risk for infection. 
PPEs such as masks and gloves can be effective in reducing the spread of
 viruses and disease within the food industry, but only if used properly
 [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h7">7</a>].
 A disinfecting robotic arm that uses an ultraviolet (UV) light 
sanitizer to clean contaminated areas is being perfected at University 
of Southern California in Los Angeles [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h9">9</a>].
 Cameras mounted on the robotic arm help the operator, located away from
 the contaminated area, to navigate the robot. The robot scans the 
surroundings also using infrared (IR) radiation to determine their depth
 and then builds a 3D model of the area. Using a gripper, the robotic 
arm is able to open drawers and closets, and manipulate objects to 
perform a thorough sanitization of hard-to-reach surfaces.</span></p>

<p class="rfont" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 22px;">Thermal imaging cameras represent a fast, contactless, 
and reliable method to detect a fever, a common symptom of COVID-19. 
IEEE members are working on projects that aim to improve the technology 
used in these cameras so they can be used in public spaces and 
commercial buildings to provide fast individual screenings to help stop 
the spread of the virus. Thermographic cameras used in the healthcare 
field must meet specific standards. For example, the screening 
technology must have a measurement accuracy of ± 0.5 ºC; several 
manufacturers of such cameras are not following those requirements. 
Then, software is being developed to help cameras meet technical 
standards required by the healthcare industry [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h10">10</a>].
 The cameras have infrared temperature sensors and motorized focus, 
which are controlled by the software’s system operator. The temperature 
sensors detect electromagnetic waves from the person and the motorized 
focus allows the camera’s operator to zoom in and out.</span></p>

<p class="rfont" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 22px;">A team of researchers at Thailand’s National 
Electronics and Computer Technology Center has built a 
temperature-screening system that can examine up to nine people at a 
time. More places are screening people so the ability to scan several at
 once could eliminate waiting lines [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h11">11</a>].
 The system combines a visible camera and a thermal imaging camera. It 
is equipped with features such as light detection and ranging (Lidar) 
remote sensing methodology and facial recognition [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h12">12</a>],
 which can be used with or without a facial covering, to determine where
 a person is standing in the camera’s field of view. The system also 
uses an algorithm that compensates for distance shift that happens with 
traditional thermal-imaging-based temperature scanners. Distance shift 
occurs when several individuals being checked are not at the same 
measuring distance, leading to a fluctuation in temperature 
measurements. Measurements from the Lidar and other inputs are used to 
compensate for variations in distance between an individual and the 
scanner.</span></p>

<p class="rfont" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 22px;">AI has been employed against infectious diseases having
 the ability to rapidly track, analyze, and diagnose various infectious 
processes in real time [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h13">13</a>].
 The ability of AI technology to augment decision-making processes is 
due to the speed of pattern recognition and the robust amount of data 
that are digested and analyzed for optimal outcomes.</span></p>

<p class="rfont" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 22px;">Augmented reality (AR), an interactive experience where
 real objects are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information,
 has been widely used as an instructional tool to help the user to 
perform the task in real world conditions [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h14">14</a>].
 Recent advancements in AR have helped assisting operators in industrial
 safety applications in a control room environment by providing extra 
information in the decision making process [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h15">15</a>].</span></p>

<p class="rfont" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 22px;">AI, Internet of things (IoT) and the resulting massive 
amount of streaming data, often referred to as Big Data, are having a 
disruptive role in food quality assessment (using sensor fusion), food 
safety (using gene sequencing and block chain-based digital 
traceability), agriculture (including intelligent farm machines and 
drone-based crop imaging), and finally supply-chain modernization [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h16">16</a>].</span></p>

<p class="rfont" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 22px;">Mixed reality (MR) is a hybrid reality where real and 
virtual objects are merged to produce an enriched interactive 
environment [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h14">14</a>]; in 2019, software taking advantage of AR and MR has been used to monitor pathogens such as <em>Salmonella</em> and <em>Listeria</em> on surfaces in factories more efficiently than paper-based monitoring methods [<a href="https://researchinfotext.com/article-details/COVID-19-Pandemic--A-Brief-Review-on-How-nbsp-Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology-Can-nbsp-Help-Shape-the-Future-of-Food-Safety#h17">17</a>].
 Software taps AI to identify areas inside manufacturing plants where 
bacteria could be present and grow. This information is then uploaded to
 a cloud-based task management system; it can also be presented in real 
time through a MR headset, allowing the user to track and add 
information whilst walking the factory floor. Following the COVID-19 
outbreak, such software has been updated for tracking the virus on 
surfaces with the same accuracy and efficiency demonstrated for other 
pathogens</span></p><p class="rfont" style="text-align: center;"><img width="301" height="167" alt="" class="art-lightbox" src="images/1.jpg"><span style="font-size: 22px;"><br></span></p><p><br></p></div>
